# Feature Mapping and tracking  

This confused me a bit. 
  - Matching: you've found all the features in both images, and now want to match them
  - Tracking: you want to find the features you've already found in the second image
  
If I were doing stereo, matching is the way to go. But I have one camera. Trackng it is.
